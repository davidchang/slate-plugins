#### Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?

<!-- 
If you have a question, ask it in the Slate Slack channel instead:

#### What's the current behavior?

<!-- 
For bugs, you **must** include the following: 

  - A JSFiddle that minimally reproduces the issue.
  - A GIF showing the issue in action.
  - Information about your OS, browser, Slate version, etc.

If you don't include these, there's a very good chance your issue will be closed, because it's much too hard to figure out exactly what is going wrong, and it makes maintenance much harder.

I need to keep the issues actionable, or else maintaining these plugins becomes overwhelming. Thank you for understanding!

#### What's the expected behavior?

<!-- 
The fastest, and most appreciated way to have your issue fixed is to create a pull request with working, tested code and we will help get it merged. Don't be scared to open a pull request that isn't completed and ask for input. I'm happy to give direction! Also, researching how other editors handle this issue is super helpful.
